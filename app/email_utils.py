app/email_utils.py

This module contains utility functions for interacting with an email server 
using the IMAP protocol. It includes functions to connect to the email server, 
search for emails, fetch email content (such as subject, sender, and body), 
and extract relevant data from email messages.

Functions:
- connect_to_email_server: Establishes a connection to the email server using IMAP.
- search_emails: Searches for emails in the INBOX folder based on a date range (days/weeks).
- fetch_email_data: Fetches the envelope (metadata) and body of a specific email by its message ID.
- decode_subject: Decodes a raw email subject header into a human-readable string.
- decode_sender: Decodes the senderâ€™s email address from a structured address object.
- extract_email_body: Extracts the plain text or HTML body from an email message.
- extract_emails: Extracts subject, sender, and body for each email given a list of message IDs.
- fetch_emails: Connects to the server, searches for emails from the past week, and returns relevant data.

Dependencies:
- imapclient: For connecting to and interacting with the email server.
- email: For parsing email messages.
- email.header: For decoding email headers (like subject).
- datetime: For manipulating date and time (searching for emails within specific date ranges).
- bs4 (BeautifulSoup): For extracting text from HTML bodies.

Raises:
- ValueError: If input parameters are invalid (e.g., non-positive integers or missing required parameters).
- IMAPClient.Error: If errors occur during connection, login, or IMAP operations.
- KeyError: If an expected message ID is missing in the server response.
- TypeError: If input types are incorrect (e.g., non-string types for subject).
- AttributeError: If required attributes are missing from sender address objects.

This module is useful for automating the process of retrieving and processing email data, such as 
email content analysis, archiving, or triggering actions based on email content.
