# Utilities Module

The Utilities module provides shared helper functions and tools used throughout the Beacon application.

## Overview

This module contains common utilities, helper functions, and tool classes that are used across multiple parts of the application. It provides functionality for tasks like logging, memory management, and asynchronous operations, ensuring consistent implementation and reducing code duplication.

## Directory Structure

```

├── __init__.py              # Package exports
├── async_helpers.py         # Asynchronous utilities
├── logging_setup.py         # Logging configuration
├── memory_profiling.py      # Memory monitoring and optimization
└── README.md                # This documentation
```

## Components

### Async Helpers
Provides utilities for working with asynchronous code in Flask, including event loop management, context preservation, and task management. Simplifies the integration of async code with Flask's synchronous request handling.

### Logging Setup
Configures application-wide logging with structured log formats, log rotation, and appropriate log levels. Provides consistent logging interfaces across the application.

### Memory Profiling
Implements tools for monitoring and optimizing memory usage, including memory tracking, leak detection, and automatic garbage collection. Critical for maintaining stable performance in memory-intensive operations.

## Usage Examples

```python
# Using async helpers
from app.utils.async_helpers import async_manager

@app.route('/data')
@async_manager.run_async
async def get_data():
    result = await fetch_data_from_api()
    return jsonify(result)

# Using logging
from app.utils.logging_setup import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Operation completed", extra={"operation_id": op_id})

# Using memory profiling
from app.utils.memory_profiling import log_memory_usage, log_memory_cleanup

log_memory_usage(logger, "Before processing")
process_large_dataset(data)
log_memory_cleanup(logger, "After processing")
```

## Internal Design

The utilities module follows these design principles:
- Small, focused functions with single responsibilities
- Consistent interfaces for similar functionality
- Proper error handling and logging
- Performance optimization
- Compatibility with Flask's execution model

## Dependencies

Internal:
- None (utilities are a foundational module)

External:
- `flask`: For request context access
- `logging`: For logging functionality
- `asyncio`: For asynchronous operations
- `psutil`: For memory profiling
- `gc`: For garbage collection control
