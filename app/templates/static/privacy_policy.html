        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Beacon uses third-party services to support various functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Service Providers:</strong> To connect to your email accounts</li>
            <li><strong>AI and Natural Language Processing Services:</strong> To analyze email content</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Services:</strong> To securely manage user access</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> To improve our application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These third-party services have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.</p>
        
        <h3>6.1 Google Workspace API Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>When you grant Beacon access to your Google Workspace data (including Gmail), we only share this data with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, including Render (cloud hosting), Cloudflare (custom domain), and Redis (caching). These providers are governed by their respective standard terms of service, which include data protection provisions.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Processing Services:</strong> We use OpenAI's API for processing email content. This processing is done according to OpenAI's standard terms of service, which allow them to use API data to improve their services, though we only send the minimum data necessary for our features to function (mainly, the email content and metadata).</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your Google Workspace data with advertisers, data brokers, or other third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Gmail API Permissions</h3>
        <p>Our application requests the following Gmail API permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Read access to your emails:</strong> To analyze and organize your inbox</li>
            <li><strong>Send emails on your behalf:</strong> To allow you to respond to emails directly from our application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you use our email response features, we may send emails via the Gmail API, which makes the emails appear as being sent directly from your Gmail account. This ensures emails you send appear in your Gmail "Sent" folder and maintain the conversation thread continuity.</p>
        
        <h3>6.3 AI Model Training Disclosure</h3>
        <p>Beacon does <strong>not</strong> use or retain user data obtained through Google Workspace APIs to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or machine learning models. Any processing of email content for email management features is performed on a per-user basis and solely for the purpose of providing the service to that specific user.</p>
