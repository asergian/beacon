# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic and Flask-Migrate.

## Structure

- `versions/`: Contains individual migration scripts
- `env.py`: Configures the migration environment
- `script.py.mako`: Template for generating new migration files
- `alembic.ini`: Alembic configuration settings

## Usage

Migrations are typically managed using the Flask-Migrate CLI commands:

```
# Create a new migration
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"

# Apply migrations to the database
flask db upgrade

# Revert the most recent migration
flask db downgrade
```

For more information, see the [Flask-Migrate documentation](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/).
